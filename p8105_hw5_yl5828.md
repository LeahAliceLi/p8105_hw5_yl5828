### Problem 1

#### Create the required function to check if there are any duplicate birthdays.

``` r
birthday_sim <- function(n_people) {
  birthdays <- sample(1:365, size = n_people, replace = TRUE)
  any(duplicated(birthdays))
}
```

#### Repeat the function 10000 times and compute and probablity that at least two people in the group will share a birthday.

``` r
set.seed(1)

sim_results <- 
  tibble(group_size = 2:50) %>% 
  mutate(
    sim_outcomes = map(group_size, ~ replicate(10000, birthday_sim(.x))),
    prob_shared  = map_dbl(sim_outcomes, mean)
  )
```

#### Creae a plot to show the results.

``` r
ggplot(sim_results, aes(x = group_size, y = prob_shared)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  labs(
    x = "Group size (n)",
    y = "Probability of ≥ 1 shared birthday",
    title = "Q1: Simulated Probability of Shared Birthdays"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Comment on the plot:

The curve shows an exponential-like growth, rapidly increasing from
near-zero probability with small groups to near-certainty with larger
groups. The simulation shows that with just 23 people, there’s
approximately a 50% chance that two people share a birthday. With 30
people, the probability rises to about 70%. With 40 people, the
probability exceeds 90%. With 50 people, the probability is nearly 97%.
